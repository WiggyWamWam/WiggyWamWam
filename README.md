- Hi, Iâ€™m @WiggyWamWam (he)
- I'm looking to pursue a vocation designing and making websites, probably of the small to medium scale.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently cementing my skills in HTML and CSS, as I have lots of experience but no formal education. I will then add JS and JQuery, and maybe Ruby (I have PHP experience but everyone tells me not to use PHP now ðŸ˜…)
- In the future I may look for small bug fixes to cement my skills, but I expect that to be the extent of my collaboration.
